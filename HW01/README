DESCRIPTION:
Design an ADT for a one-person guessing game that chooses n random integers in
the range from 1 to m and asks the user to guess them. The same integer might be
chosen more than once. For every example, the game might choose the following
four integers that range from 1 to 10: 4,6,1,6.
  The following interactions could occur between the user and the game, after
the user has specified integers m and n:

"Enter your guesses for the 4 integers int the range from 1 to 10 that have
been selected: "
1 2 3 4
"2 of your guesses are correct. Guess again."
"Enter your guesses for the 4 integers int the range from 1 to 10 that have
been selected: "
2 4 6 8
"2 of your guesses are correct. Guess again."
1 4 6 6
"You are correct! Play again?" No
Good-bye!

************Structure***********
Program is stored in 3 files, main.cpp, Guess.h, and Guess.cpp.
All implementations are stored in the Guess.cpp and main.cpp is used as a very
basic driver file that handles only the overarching loop.

At the start to program the user is asked whether they desire to play against
ordered or unordered numbers. If unordered, the numbers are left in their
initial state of random generation. If ordered, the numbers are sorted using
bubble sort.

The rest of the gameplay is as outlined in the DESCRIPTION.



If the user desires to see the computers number displayed, look for the
tagged line(lines 53-57) labeled as:

// // ****************************************
// // ** Un-comment below to have the       **
// // ** computer show its selected number  **
// // ****************************************
// std::cout << this->printNumbers();

in "int Guess::startGuess()" function in "Guess.cpp".
