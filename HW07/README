****************************************
** TO COMPILE ----- 'make all'	      **
** TO RUN --------- './name' #binary  **
****************************************

DESCRIPTION:
Based on the BinaryNodeTree example in Chapter16

Implement a new function

replace (item: ItemType, replacementItem ItemType) : boolean

This function locates, if possible, the node in a binary tree that contains item
and replaces item with replacementItem. Add this operation replace to the current
implementation. The operation should replace an item without alerting the tree
structure.

You don't have to implement every missing function in BinaryNodeTree.h
(Listing 16-3.h) but you need to implement a few such as contains, findNode, etc.

Develop a main driver function that takes words from a text file and construct
a binary tree. Each word from a text file is stored as a string. Let's assume
there's no special character in the input text file, and there's no duplicate
words in the input text file.

After completing the replace function, run contains for previous item and
replace item to verify the operation.


Grading guideline

Correct and complete functionality of the two programs 70%
Reasonable fault tolerance, i.e. it should not crash often. 10%
Makefile and Readme 10%
Documentation and comments in the code 10%
