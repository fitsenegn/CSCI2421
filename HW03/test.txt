Course Description
This course explores the entire entrepreneurial cycle, from inspiration to IPO. Teams of students will perform much of the work required to create and launch a new company. The course will culminates in a “pitch fest” to area entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. This is one of two alternative capstone courses for the Inworks Minor in Design and Innovation. Enrollment may be limited.
